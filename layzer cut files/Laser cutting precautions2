if the line should been cut through, the line color should be pure black, and the strock is 0.01
if the line should been burnt, the line color should be pure red, and the strock is 0.01
if you want to burn a pattern, the pattern mode and vector mode should be both on, and the color should be pure red

tips: you can pre-cut first through choosing the sitimulate mode and it won't hurt the board
